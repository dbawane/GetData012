Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals.

These time domain signals (post 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

2     body-acceleration-mean()-y-time
3	body-acceleration-mean()-z-time
4	body-acceleration-std()-x-time
5	body-acceleration-std()-y-time
6	body-acceleration-std()-z-time

7	gravity-acceleration-mean()-x-time

9	gravity-acceleration-mean()-z-time
10	gravity-acceleration-std()-x-time
11	gravity-acceleration-std()-y-time
12	gravity-acceleration-std()-z-time


Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.

15	body-acceleration-jerk-mean()-z-time
16	body-acceleration-jerk-std()-x-time
17	body-acceleration-jerk-std()-y-time
18	body-acceleration-jerk-std()-z-time

Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

40	body-gyro-jerk-magnitude-std()-time

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency domain signals

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
